	abstract = {Marketing has matured to the point where it seems desirable to take stock of where we are, what we have learned, and fruitful directions for extending the knowledge base that has developed. Science is a process involving the interaction between empirical generalizations and theory. An empirical generalization is ?a pattern or regularity that repeats over different circumstances and that can be described simply by mathematical, graphic, or symbolic methods.? One of the purposes of the Empirical Generalizations Conference held at Wharton on February 16?18, 1994 was to develop a list of examples of such empirical generalizations in marketing. Empirical generalization can precede a theory to explain it or it can be predicted by a theory. Science is the process of interaction between theory and data that leads to higher level theories. Examples are provided here of empirical generalizations in marketing and their theoretical counterparts. One example is provided of a higher level theory.},

After a presentation of the intellectual project, as an inductive approach to language based on the exploration of corpora, we present the principles of correspondence analysis, which is the main method developed in the Data Analysis School, used for corpus analysis but also for many other types of datasets. Then, we will focus on textual data analysis. Based on the fact that software programmes have played a major role in the use of these statistical techniques, we shall examine a selection of these, display their specificities and their underlying theoretical bases.},

We estimate a fixed effects VARX model with dynamic and interactive effects for multiple brands based on pooled time series and cross-sectional data for two product categories. The Impulse Response Analysis (IRA) results for one category (tuna) under different scenarios show that the inclusion/exclusion of competitive reaction- and feedback effects matters a lot, consistent with a high degree of competitive interaction in this market. We find that the role of cross-brand feedback effects is greater than the role of traditional competitive reaction effects. Intrafirm effects (internal decisions) also play an important role. In a decomposition study we show that the exclusion of these effects may either increase (up to 12\%) or decrease (by as much as 50\%) the net unit sales effect of a 20\% price reduction. By contrast, in the second category (shampoo), where brands have distinct positions, the exclusion of these effects matters very little.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Variance-based SEM, also known under the term partial least squares (PLS) analysis, is an approach that has gained increasing interest among marketing researchers in recent years. During the last 25years, more than 30 articles have been published in leading marketing journals that have applied this approach instead of the more traditional alternative of covariance-based SEM (CBSEM). However, although an analysis of these previous publications shows that there seems to be at least an implicit agreement about the factors that should drive the choice between PLS analysis and CBSEM, no research has until now empirically compared the performance of these approaches given a set of different conditions. Our study addresses this open question by conducting a large-scale Monte-Carlo simulation. We show that justifying the choice of PLS due to a lack of assumptions regarding indicator distribution and measurement scale is often inappropriate, as CBSEM proves extremely robust with respect to violations of its underlying distributional assumptions. Additionally, CBSEM clearly outperforms PLS in terms of parameter consistency and is preferable in terms of parameter accuracy as long as the sample size exceeds a certain threshold (250 observations). Nevertheless, PLS analysis should be preferred when the emphasis is on prediction and theory development, as the statistical power of PLS is always larger than or equal to that of CBSEM; already, 100 observations can be sufficient to achieve acceptable levels of statistical power given a certain quality of the measurement model.
